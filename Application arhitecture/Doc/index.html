        <p style="font-size:large;">

    <section id="concepts-on-design">
        <h2>General design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size:large;">
                
            This is a single-page application (SPA),that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server.
            </li>
            <li style="font-size:large;">
                Provides various options structured as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size:large;">A user profile page where the information about a specific user is displayed </li>
                    <li style="font-size:large;">A cat profile page where the information about a specific cat is displayed</li>
                    <li style="font-size:large;">A page with the newest cats </li>
                    <li style="font-size:large;">A page with top owners depending on the number of the cats the own</li>
                    <li style="font-size:large;">A home page from where you can go to the generate svg/png page to get some statistics from the website</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="intermediate-steps">
        <h2>Intermediate steps</h2>
        <p style="font-size:large;">Between these two components, some thinking about the spa structure, data handeling from the public API, and data storage on the client side was involved.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="data-modeling">
        <h2>Data modeling</h2>
       <p>This application doesn't have a database to store the informations, we make API requests directly to the official site servers.To work with the data from these requests, we map the json we get after the request to a javascript object.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="storage">
        <h2>Storage solutions available at the client level</h2>
        <p>All the kitties and owners are saved into lists after a user checks their profile. Before an api request, a search through these lists takes place, and an api request is made only if necessary.</p>
